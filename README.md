### Hi, it's Joyce here - a developer based in Tokyo, Japan with a background in English teaching and Fashion Design.  Strangely, my first encounter on coding was when I first dabbled in HTML to create a fansite for my favorite American singer.  Currently, my focus has been on Ruby, Rails, Vanilla JavaScript and React.
